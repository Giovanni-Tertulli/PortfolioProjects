# [Movie Industry: how does budget impact gross revenue and the number of reviews a movie receives?](https://github.com/Giovanni-Tertulli/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/movies_project.ipynb)

> This project was initially inspired by "Alex The Analyst" YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPYVYBtUTyE
> The 'Movie Industry' dataset includes all the movies released since 1980. It is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies), with a more detailed description.

> In this project, I explore the relationships between the budget involved in movies production and the output in terms of gross revenues and number of votes and ratings. 
> This project uses some simple correlation analysis tools and relies mainly on Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Limitations
- The goal of the project was to practice graphings and visualisations. The depth of the analysis is, for the time being, limited. It will be expanded in future projects.
- Although more budget is positively correlated to both more gross revenue and number of votes, it could be argued that a movie with a higher production budget could also have higher marketing expenditures and an overall more structured advertising effort. More advertising increases the exposure of the movie and could have an impact on both the revenue and the number of ratings and reviews. This project does not take that into account, but future analyses could dig deeper into that.
